## üöÄ Setup & Getting Started

Gryphon is a **template**, and **self-hosting is required**. Follow the steps below to clone and configure your own bot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Essential Configuration (`config.json`)

Before running, rename `config-example.json` to **`config.json`** and populate it with your credentials:

```json
{
    "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
    "mongo_db_uri": "YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING",
    "language": "en_US"
}
````

  * **Token:** Get this from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
  * **MongoDB URI:** You can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) or a local MongoDB instance.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning:** Never share your bot token or database credentials publicly\!

### üíª 2. Build and Run

Gryphon requires **CMake \>= 3.16** and the **mongo-cxx-driver** installed on your system.

#### üêß Linux (Manual Installation Example)

This example shows the manual steps to install the necessary libraries (`mongo-cxx-driver` and `DPP`) before building Gryphon.

##### Install `mongo-cxx-driver` and `DPP`

1.  **Install system dependencies (e.g., Fedora/dnf):**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install openssl-devel curl-devel cyrus-sasl-devel pkgconf-pkg-config
    ```
2.  **Build and install `mongo-cxx-driver`:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.git](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver.git) --branch releases/stable 
    cd mongo-cxx-driver/build 
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local 
    make -j$(nproc) 
    sudo make install
    ```
3.  **Install DPP:** Follow the specific instructions for your distribution on the [DPP Installation Guide](https://dpp.dev/installing.html).

##### Build Gryphon

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/apozinn/axion.git](https://github.com/apozinn/axion.git) 
cd axion
mkdir build && cd build 
cmake .. 
make -j$(nproc)
```

##### Run

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64
./gryphon # Renamed the executable to match the bot name
```

#### ü™ü Windows (Recommended: vcpkg)

Using **vcpkg** is the simplest way to manage the C++ dependencies for Windows.

1.  **Prerequisites:** Install [Visual Studio 2019/2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (with C++ and CMake tools) and [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
2.  **Install Libraries (`mongo-cxx-driver` and `DPP`):**
    ```powershell
    vcpkg install mongo-cxx-driver dpp
    ```
3.  **Clone and Configure:**
    ```powershell
    git clone [https://github.com/apozinn/axion.git](https://github.com/apozinn/axion.git)
    cd axion/
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
    ```
4.  **Build and Run:**
    ```powershell
    cmake --build . --config Release
    .\Release\gryphon.exe # Renamed the executable to match the bot name
